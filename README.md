## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
$ pnpm build
```

If you want to zip the file, run the following:

```bash
$ pnpm package
```
